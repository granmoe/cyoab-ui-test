child views will be attached to and rendered into the following DOM nodes that the app view creates:

#left-sidebar  -  this can have supporting material
#main-content  -  this can have the main "story" and buttons for user interactions
#right-sidebar  -  this can have conflicting material

there is also

#header
#footer

need to abstract "story" logic and encapsulate in a model/view
	this will include the story text, choices to be displayed, and the positions beind the choices
	position is added to user's story model
	relevant queries are run and material added to for/against collections of the position
	need a way to abstract the construction of the positions that doesn't depend on particulars of each

Summary page that shows the choices the user made and material for / against each choice
Can add features later like comparing to other known interpretations
